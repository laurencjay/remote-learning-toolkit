## Description 
In this activity, students are asked to share prior knowledge of a topic and to help begin discussion. The educator will provide a question for students to investigate and contribute resources on. These questions should be basic and exploratory in nature, just to get a sense of what students have been previously exposed to. In response, students will share videos related to that topic which can viewed live or shared on a discussion board to review on their own time. This activity should utilized before a student has studied the topic in question so the educator can evaluate their knowledge. It is a great activity to be used in a first class. 

## Example 

In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students are asked to contribute videos on a discussion topic. The topic in question is "Give me an example of time you saw technology used in popular culture." Students provide short videos to share on that topic in a discussion board with a few reflections on what they took from this viewing experience. The instructor then uses these reflections to select topics for future discussion and guide conversation in the next class. Here are some of the videos the students shared: 
- [Carrie's laptop from Sex in the City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWSZJXhOvBw)
- [Video Game episode of Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9WVSy7JpT4)
- [Bandersnatch trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wnRi3Sclm8)

These videos led to further discussions on students perceptions of the technology, if they see the references as progressive or dated, and how the technologies portrayed have changed.
