**Needed Materials:** Smartphone, [Toontastic Application](https://toontastic.withgoogle.com/).  
**Time to Complete:** 20 minutes
**In Synchronous Classrooms:** Ask students to present their videos.   
**In Asynchronous Classrooms:** Ask students to share their videos in a discussion space.   
**For future use:** Save videos in a wiki or shared canvas page for future classes to explore.   

## Description 
In this activity students are asked to answer a broad question about a topic they are unfamiliar with. They are asked to showcase prior knowledge and spark discussion through this exercise. The educator will provide a few questions for students to answer. In response, students will share or post a video they animate using Toontastic, a 3-D animation mobile app, as an answer to the question. In this app, students can record their voice over video, the application provides the scenes and students can do their own 'light' animation of the scene. The educator should use these videos to 1. better understand where students' pre-existing knowledge levels are at and 2. propel discussion forward on a new topic.

## Example 

In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students are asked about their understanding of technology and innovation. The question posed "What gadget, device, or other new technology do you wish someone would invent?" The students are asked to post their videos on Canvas and comment on a few of their classmates ideas. These answers expose the educator to the types of problems students are interested in and what technology they are using. The instructor can use this as a jumping off point to share examples of other emerging technologies (either in discussion or via articles in the discussion board), and how they related to the examples given by the students. Here is an example of [one of the student videos.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18z_fQqy4NoTqL-1Ha0uKJa8KU-HzmFBt/view?usp=sharing)
