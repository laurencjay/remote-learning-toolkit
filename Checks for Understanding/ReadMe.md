## Description
This exercise asks students to create their own checks for understanding to review material discussed in class. This could be as a component of a larger presentation, a full review game that students are asked to contribute to prior to an assessment, or even as an assessment alternative. After the content has been delivered, the students can run the Kahoot quiz themselves and ask other students to participate on their devices. The Kahoots can also be made publicly available for students to complete on their own time as review.

## Example
In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students are asked to select a new technology to discuss and do a short 10 minute presentation in class. A new student presents on a different topic each week. The students are then asked to create a short review game using Kahoot to check for students understanding. This week, I picked the topic of NFTs and [here is the Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/nfts-cfu/0a35bd20-d66f-49b8-aae9-e7fe31ccb39d) I made to share with the class after my presentation.
