**Time to Complete:** 1 hour plus reading time.   
**In Synchronous Classrooms:** Listen to recordings before or in class and respond to the student live.   
**In Asynchronous Classrooms:** Listen to the recordings at home and leave comments on class discussion board.    
**For future use:** Save the recordings to a shared discussion page or repository for future use.  

## Description
In this activity, students are asked to record a book review on a reading they complete for class. This review is recorded via audio, instead of written, and shared with the class in a shared RSS feed or discussion board. The students can listen to the recordings before class and respond to them asynchronously, or their responses can become a part of the live follow-up discussion. This activity gives students the opportunity to engage with material in a different media format and to hear their classmates reactions through the recordings, creating a more personal and connected learning experience.

## Example
In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students read [The Idea Factory by John Gertner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11797471-the-idea-factory) to study the history of innovation. Each student was asked to contribute a book review on a specific chapter of the book, with a new student posting their review each week. Students listened to the review before class and then discussed the chapter, and the points brought up by the reviewer, in class. [Here is the link](https://github.com/laurencjay/remote-learning-toolkit/blob/main/Discussion%20Posts/New%20Recording.m4a) to a review of Chapter 2 of the book for this class.
