# Blog Posts and Annotation
**When to Use:** Any discussion based topic, as an alternative to a writing assignment.  
**Needed Materials:** Computer, [Medium](https://medium.com/) account or access to shared blog platform that you create such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) account (a web annotation tool).     
**Time to Complete:** 1 hour.  
**In Synchronous Classrooms:** Develop discussion questions around the posts shared.  
**In Asynchronous Classrooms:** Only have students comment on the post using Hypothesis.   
**For future use:** [Create an RSS feed of the medium posts](https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/medium-rss-feeds-df32ba80f8f) or if you all using the same blog platform, keep it hosted online for access and contribution by future students.   

## Description
In this exercise, students are asked to write a blog post on a discussion topic or a topic the educator selects. This could be on a reading for a previous week, or a question posed to the students based on previous discussion. The students will post their response in the form of a blog post that will be shared either on Medium or a shared class blog if you so choose. The second step of this exercise is the actual discussion, which will take place via Hypothesis. Students should make an account and post a comment or question on each of their classmates blog posts. Through Hypothesis, students will be able to see not just their comments, but other students, and follow up and respond to their comments, similar to a discussion board.

## Example
In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students are discussing GPT-3 and asked to write a blog post about this week's readings on the topic prior to the next class. The blog posts are shared to a centralized RSS feed and students are asked to leave comments on their classmates' posts using Hypothesis. As an example, I've left comments on [this Hackernoon post](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-gpt-3-and-why-do-we-need-it-673j34q7) about GPT-3.
