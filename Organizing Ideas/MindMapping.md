# Mind Mapping

**When to Use:** Brainstorming, Problem solving.    
**Needed Materials:** Internet connected device, [Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/)   
**Time to Complete:** Any length of time.     
**In Synchronous Classrooms:** Students co-create these maps together in class.  
**In Asynchronous Classrooms:**  Students share a map and add thoughts asynchronously.  
**For future use:** Save links to maps in a repository or document for future classes. Future students can also add to the same maps. 

## Description 
This exercise is designed to help students ideate and problem solve in a group setting. Students are given a topic to brainstorm together or a problem to answer. They then use a mind-mapping tool such as Miro to draw a mental map of ideas or possible solutions. They can then present those mind maps to their classmates, creating opportunity to further discuss the topic.

## Example 

In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students discuss problems and risks that technology can create. During this class, students are discussing Artificial Intelligence and possible risks. They are broken up into small groups to map the topic. They then share what they discussed with the classmates, intentionally looking to places of overlap. An example of one of those mind maps is found below.
