# Mind Mapping

**When to Use:** Brainstorming, Problem solving.    
**Needed Materials:** Internet connected device, [Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/)   
**Time to Complete:** Any length of time.     
**In Synchronous Classrooms:** Students co-create these maps together in class.  
**In Asynchronous Classrooms:**  Students share a map and add thoughts asynchronously.  
**For future use:** Save links to maps in a repository or document for future classes. Future students can also add to the same maps. 

## Description 
This exercise is designed to help students ideate and problem solve in a group setting. Students are given a topic to brainstorm together or a problem to answer. They then use a mind-mapping tool such as Miro to draw a mental map of ideas or possible solutions. They can then present those mind maps to their classmates, creating opportunity to further discuss the topic. This activity is particularly valuable for continued co-creation throughout both the current course as well as other previous iterations. Students have the ability to build off of each other's mind maps and to contribute to those from past cohorts, adding new knowledge and context to previous ideas. This creates a robust network of knowledge students can rely on in their course.

## Example 

In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students discuss problems and risks that technology can create. During this class, students are discussing Artificial Intelligence and possible risks. They are broken up into small groups to map the topic. Here is the map created by the first group.

They then share what they discussed and wrote with their classmates. Other students will ask questions and even add thoughts as they come up onto the map. As discussion continues, each of the mind maps evolves. The previous image of the mind map looks like this by the end of class.
