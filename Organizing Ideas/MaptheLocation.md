## Description 
This exercise is designed to help students vizualize the locations from a story by mapping their locations. This works well for studies that are grounded in specific places. In this exercise, students will create their own map using the [My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/) feature of google maps. Here, students can add any number of locations to layers of the map and share additional information from the story. Students can then share and explore each other's maps, using street view to further examine the locations. This exercise is a great opportunity for students to share a story or present on a specific topic in a unique format. It also allows for a more immersive experience allowing students to explore and actually see the places they are studying.

## Example 

In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students are reading the book The Idea Factory on the history of Bell Labs. In order to contextualize their readings, students are asked to map major locations from the book [The Idea Factory](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?hl=en&mid=1iSZilC8Ie4odaGKK8HzklEkumq9YqXqb&ll=40.36536968188619%2C-74.1671512&z=18). They then shared the maps with each other and are given time to explore them individually before continuing their discussion. Students are particularly amazed by the location of the Bell Labs Holmdel, NJ Headquarters and how the space was abandoned in the early 2000s at the Labs were bought out and downsized.
