## Description 
This activity is designed for presentations and gives students a interactive way to view and engage with student projects. In [Gather.town](https://gather.town/), students create an avatar and explore a space with their classmates. The space can be designed to suit any classroom purpose, in this case, it is utilized for presentations. There is a small amount of prep work that would go into this as students would need to provide a static link to their presentation or upload a video that can be shared so that the educator can set up the space. Students should be encouraged to customize their own presentation areas to facilitate the learning of others. Students can visit the space during classtime and listen to their classmates give live presentations or watch the recordings at any time by visit the room. If other students are present, they can speak to eachother using proximity chat when they are nearby. Utilizing a tool like gather.town allows students to experience co-creation by developing a learning space and presenting on topics they learned together.

## Example 

In an Emerging Technologies Class at LJ University, students are presenting their final capstones to the class. All students create an avatar and join [The Gallery Walk](https://gather.town/app/vtEHdOW8VV5JF6uI/The%20Gallery%20Walk) space. Inside, specific locations have been designated for presentations and students rotate around the room to view the different presentations. Half of the class presents first, and then they switch, giving students the opportunity to be both the presenter and the observer. Students are able to ask live questions of the presenters they are watching in real time.
