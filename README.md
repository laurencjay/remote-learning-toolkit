# remote-learning-toolkit
This Remote Learning Toolkit is a project for my Spring Semester Studies in Educational Technology Course at Georgetown University. It provides a series of resources educators can easily implement in remote learning environments.

**How to navigate this space**
The toolkit is intended to allow educators to 'plug and play' various activities into their course plans. They are designed for remote learning experiences but are adaptable for both synchronous and asynchronous interactions. Please click a link below to explore the activity. 

**Examples in the Toolkit**
In order to showcase how these exercises can be used in the classroom, I developed a sample class (Emerging Technologies) and university (LJ University).
